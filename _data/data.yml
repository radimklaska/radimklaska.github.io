career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I started working with computers around the year 2000 and got into developing websites in 2004.
      I discovered Drupal during the 4.7 / 5.4 era (2007) and stayed with it ever since.
      
      By working with various clients I gained lots of experience in site building, theming and even some Linux sysadmin skills.
      Since then I worked on some big sites as a backend developer and slowly shifted towards DevOps and CI/CD.
      
      I'm best known as one of the leading members of the Czech Drupal community. I'm passionate about using best practices
      and likes to discover new elegant solutions.
      
      I'm an Open Source Enthusiast. This led me through some interesting side quests.

experiences:
    - role: Drupal Backend developer & DevOps
      time: 2014 - Present
      company: Morpht Pty. Ltd.
      details: |
        I had a number of roles at [Morpht](https://www.morpht.com) over the years. I started as a Drupal developer and site builder.
        Did my fair share of theme coding and form altering. Moved over to do more development. Currently, I manage and coordinate
        security updates across all projects at Morpht. I'm also making sure all of our builds and tests are running smoothly and
        all developers are set up for success with their local environments using [Lando](https://lando.dev). Automating as much as possible
        from a developer setting up a local copy to production deployment.

      time: 2011 - 2014
      company: PLAYzone s. r. o.

        Learned a lot by working with a great team, receiving code reviews, having a chance to architect solutions and watching projects grow.
    - role: Drupal site builder
      time: 2006 - 2011
      company: Freelance
      details: |
        I was lucky to gain trust and awesome references from many clients. This was a steep learning curve while juggling meetings with clients,
        working on sites and managing a small team of my schoolmates who helped me with design and site-building.
        I also started managing my first [Aegir](https://www.aegirproject.org) server to host all client sites.
