career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I started working with computers around the year 2000 and got into developing websites in 2004.
      I discovered Drupal during the 4.7 / 5.4 era (2007) and stayed with it ever since.
      
      By working with various clients I gained lots of experience in site building, theming and even some sysadmin skills.
      Since then I worked on some big sites.
      
      I'm best known as one of the leading members of Czech Drupal community. I'm passionate about using best practices and likes to discover new elegant solutions.
